== Understand the Globex Retail System Architecture

The Globex system (workshop environment) consists of microservices applications that are deployed across multiple platforms such as virtual machines and a container platform as depicted below.

Your initial state for this workshop is an environment that is spread over Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Your application has already been partially moved from your legacy environments to OpenShift.

The Globex retail system is multiple services consisting of a _Node.js_ *frontend* service which is getting its data via a *gateway* service. The gateway service is connected to three backend services such as *customers*, *orders* and *inventory*. Each service uses its own database to store data.

The services running on OpenShift are deployed in a namespace `retail-%USERID%`. The services are eventually managed using the *OpenShift GitOps* and *Pipelines* in a later module.

[NOTE]
====
Initially you are using the customers VM on Red Hat Virtualization.

You might see the customers pod is failed to run due to _ImagePullBackOff Error_. It will be fixed when you finish in the OpenShift CI/CD and GitOps module. This is because you have not created the container image for the modernized customer application.
====

All source code for the applications as well as the GitOps YAML manifests for all services are stored in a (GitHub compatible) *Gitea* repository that for workshop purposes is hosted on the OpenShift cluster.

The problem right now is the *customers* service:

* The customers service uses an old Java code base running on `Apache Tomcat` in a VM on `Red Hat Virtualization`. In this module you will assess and analyze the legacy Java application (customers) to learn the way you can modernize the Java code and then deploy the application to OpenShift on top of Red Hat JBoss Web Server.
* The customers database is using an `Oracle database` running as a VM in Red Hat Virtualization. Because this is Oracle you can not deploy the database as a Pod on OpenShift - therefore you will have a new virtual machine based on `OpenShift Virtualization` migrated by the `OpenShift Migration Toolkit for Virtualization`.

When you have finished the all modules in this demo, your TO-BE deployment architecture should look like this:
